        </ul>
        
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Read about all the changes below, and read on to find out about upcoming changes. 
      </p>   
          
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Home</h2> 
        <p class="govuk-body">
        We have changed the homepage, introducing text explaining each section to make it easier for new users. The coloured tiles have been removed.</p>  
        <p class="govuk-body">
        You can now navigate directly to the different sections under Grant Schemes and Grant Awards using quick links.</p>  
        <p class="govuk-body">
        We introduced a notification banner to update you on any changes to the system.</p>  
        
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Reports (Now called Downloads)</h2> 
        <p class="govuk-body">
        We have retired the old Reports feature because it was prone to errors and did not meet our users’ needs.</p>  
        <p class="govuk-body">
        We have replaced it with a feature called Downloads which includes options for you to download data that was previously accessible through Reports.</p>  
        <p class="govuk-body">
        You can then do further filtering, analysis and visualisation using Excel or another tool on your computer.</p>    
        <p class="govuk-body">
        We have removed the How to video for using Reports and Dashboards because it is no longer accurate.</p>
        
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">View Schemes and View Grants in Aid</h2> 
        <p class="govuk-body">
        You can now use multiple enhanced filters to further refine your results.</p>  
        <p class="govuk-body">
        We have added a Download results button that allows you to download a CSV of the results of your search and filters.</p>  
        <p class="govuk-body">
        We have introduced the option to Change View to see more details about your search results.</p>    
        <p class="govuk-body">
        We have rewritten the content on this page to make it more helpful.</p>
    
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">View Awards and Associated Awards</h2> 
        <p class="govuk-body">
        Improved content for View Awards with clearer options for searching your awards. As with View Schemes and View Grants in Aid, new view, filter and download options are available.</p> 
        <p class="govuk-body">
        Associated Awards has been changed to match the style and functionality of View Awards.</p> 
        
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">View Recipients and viewing a single recipient</h2> 
        <p class="govuk-body">
        View Recipients has changed to match the style of the other View pages. Summary information on number and value of grants recipients have been awarded is now displayed.</p>   
        <p class="govuk-body">
        The page layout for viewing a single recipient has changed so you no longer need to navigate between tabs.</p>  
        <p class="govuk-body">
        You can now download a list of all awards to that recipient.</p>  
        
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Previous Uploads and Associated Documents</h2> 
        <p class="govuk-body">
        We have changed the design of these pages to match the styles elsewhere, the functionality remains the same.
      </p>    
        
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What’s new page</h2> 
        <p class="govuk-body">
        We have added a What’s new page (that’s here!) to inform users of changes to GGiS. Users will be able to see the latest release notes on the front page and access archived notes below.
